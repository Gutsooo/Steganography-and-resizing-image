<h1>Assignment 2 - Computer Vision</h1>
<p>Welcome to the repository for the <strong>Second Assignment</strong> of the <strong>Computer Vision</strong> course. This assignment focuses on advanced image processing techniques, including grayscale conversion, image resizing, and steganography.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Convert Grayscale Image to Black and White</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Developed a function to convert grayscale images to black and white using an innovative method devised by ourselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Image Resizing with Bilinear and Nearest Neighbor Interpolation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Implemented both <strong>Bilinear</strong> and <strong>Nearest Neighbor</strong> methods for image resizing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Custom Image Resizing Function</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented an <code>imresize</code> function to achieve high-quality resizing with the best possible PSNR values, leveraging our creativity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Steganography</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Implemented a steganography function to hide one image within another while maintaining the quality and integrity of both images.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>The assignment includes the following MATLAB tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert grayscale images to black and white using an innovative approach.</li>
<li>Implement bilinear and nearest neighbor interpolation methods for image resizing.</li>
<li>Develop a custom image resizing function with optimized PSNR.</li>
<li>Create a steganography function to embed and extract images.</li>
</ul>
